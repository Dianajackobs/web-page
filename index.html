						<h2>Our Work</h2>
						<p>  
							We have years of experience working with standard to high risk survivors for a short window from the point of crisis, we asses the risk level, discuss suitable options and develop safety plan. A critical aspect of our role is to develop a safety plan with the client in order to manage the risk of further harm violence or homicide by addressing the immediate threat. Safety plans usually address immediate safety and include practical steps that women can use to protect themselves and their children as well as longer term solutions.
							 
							The impact of covid has seen a huge increase in the amount of survivors needing support. There is a lack of services available to client’s, and resources and services have been stretched beyond capacity leaving women and children left without vital support.  We have vowed investigate all possible alternatives for my clients, to advocate strongly for them within the existing systems and even to look for more unconventional solutions to ensure that the client’s are able to reach safety.  
							 
							Our service is a free voluntary non profit run by and for survivors of abuse. We do this work because we care.
